Hi guys!

This is my first exprience of blogging on Static Blogging Ecosystems like `Jekyll` and i think it would be best one :)
I am `Farhad Karimi` from Iran,Linux guy who love to learn and building new things and share that with others.I Love Programming 
and System Level things(Kernel, Embeded,etc..) also Java / Ruby addict :D

This is my new home to sharing my works , problems and maybe expriences around programming and linux world with readers.
I would appriciate receiving your feedback.

Thank you;
